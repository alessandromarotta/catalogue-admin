Silverstripe Catalogue
======================

Provides a product and category admin for silverstripe with extendable
templates, designed to mirror the CMS (but work independantly).

This module is designed to replace the current i-lateral Silverstripe
commerce module and will only provide the product admin and templates
part of the module (the rest will be provided via a new "Silverstripe
Orders" module).
